### Analysis of Long Period Events in January 2024 on the Reykjanes Peninsula, Iceland ###

This project has been done by B. Sc. Leah M. Rees finished on the 01st of August, 2024.


The report for Volcanoseismology MGPW02 by Prof. Dr. Eva Eibl focused on analyzing a specific type of volcanic event within the month of January 2024. The primary task was to create and analyze an event catalog from scratch, following the methodologies taught in class. This involved detailed examination and classification of seismic events, and subsequently, creating visual representations of these events. Through the process of catalog creation, analysis, and figure generation, the report aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the seismic activity during this period.
